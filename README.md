# Company-Sentiment-AI

This is a personal project that (may periodically) scrape and parse data about a certain company from a certain website like Google News and then uses an AI (NLP) or classification model to determine the overall sentiment/portrayal of the company in the news. This project will be divided into two parts.

The first part will be the scraping/parsing component.

The second part will be the analysis component.
